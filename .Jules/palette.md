## 2024-03-01 - Add Cursor Position Indicator to Tkinter GUI
**Learning:** Adding dynamic, context-aware information (like a cursor position tracking Ln/Col) is a high-value, low-effort micro-UX improvement for code editors. Tkinter `Text` / `ScrolledText` indices (row.col) map very nicely to this. For accessibility/robustness, checking `hasattr` before updating is crucial to avoid startup errors during widget initialization. Headless test runs of Tkinter code on Linux require both `python3-tk` and `xvfb` (`xvfb-run pytest`).
**Action:** When working on text editing widgets across different frameworks, prioritize adding a cursor position indicator early, as it significantly enhances user navigation and debugging. Always ensure proper headless testing dependencies are available in CI/development environments for GUI code.

## 2024-05-15 - Make Output Text Areas Read-Only
**Learning:** Using `tk.DISABLED` on a `ScrolledText` widget when it's meant to be an output display panel (like for parsed results or validation messages) prevents users from accidentally typing into it. It removes confusion about whether their typing in the output panel affects the application state. Setting `focus_set()` on the main input editor upon startup further streamlines the user workflow.
**Action:** When designing tools with an "Input -> Output" split pane, always ensure the Output pane is properly marked read-only and handle state toggles (`tk.NORMAL` -> insert text -> `tk.DISABLED`) during programmatic updates. Give immediate focus to the primary input area.

## 2024-06-05 - Fix Tkinter Dark Theme Button Flashing
**Learning:** When styling Tkinter buttons with custom background colors for dark themes (like `bg='#3c3f41'`), it's essential to also define `activebackground` and `activeforeground`. If these aren't specified, the button will jarringly flash the OS default light grey color during the brief moment it is clicked, breaking the dark theme experience.
**Action:** Always test dark theme button clicks. Include `activebackground` (usually a slightly lighter shade of the main background, like `#5c5f61`) and `activeforeground` to match the theme and prevent visual jarring.
