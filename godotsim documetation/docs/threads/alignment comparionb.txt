## Status Review: EngAIn Core Systems

### **The 4 Skills Listed (These are MY tools, not your code):**

| Skill | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `engain-synthesis-engine` | 🔧 **Available Tool** | I can generate these artifacts for you |
| `engain-kernel-builder` | 🔧 **Available Tool** | I can build MR kernels on demand |
| `engain-adapter-generator` | 🔧 **Available Tool** | I can generate adapters |
| `engain-validator-builder` | 🔧 **Available Tool** | I can create test harnesses |

*These aren't finished systems - they're skills I use to help you build.*

### **Your Complete Tech Stack:**

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **ZW (semantic blocks)** | ✅ **Specification exists** | ZW-S v1.0 frozen, multiple formats defined |
| **ZON/ZONB** | ✅ **Pipeline working** | "ZW→ZONB→Godot rendering pipeline verified" |
| **ZON4D** | 🟡 **Partially implemented** | Temporal system designed, core exists, advanced features pending |
| **AP (Anti-Python)** | 🟡 **Designed, implementation unclear** | Rules defined, integration with kernels pending |
| **Python runtime** | ✅ **Operational** | HTTP server, state authority confirmed |
| **Godot 4.x client** | ✅ **Operational** | Thin client, ZWRuntime adapter working |
| **HTTP layer** | ✅ **Functional** | Python ↔ Godot communication verified |
| **Metta extraction (Pass1/2/3)** | 🟡 **Designed, status unknown** | 4-pass narrative pipeline documented |

### **What's NOT Finished (From This Thread):**

| System | Status | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Quest System** | ❌ **Not started** | Blocks Dream State, Act Compression |
| **Inventory System** | ❌ **Not started** | Needed for gameplay features |
| **NPC Dialogue System** | 🟡 **Basic only** | Complex branching not implemented |
| **Dream State features** | ❌ **Design only** | Phase 2-4 work, needs quest foundation |
| **Act Compression** | 🟡 **GDScript prototype exists** | Needs Python authority version |
| **Multi-aesthetic switching** | ❌ **Design only** | Needs asset pipeline |

---

## The Truth:

**What you HAVE built:**
- ✅ Core EngAIn architecture (Python authority + Godot rendering)
- ✅ 5 working subsystems (Spatial, Perception, Navigation, Behavior, Combat)
- ✅ ZW→ZONB content pipeline
- ✅ HTTP communication layer

**What's DESIGNED but incomplete:**
- 🟡 ZON4D temporal features (beyond basics)
- 🟡 AP rule integration
- 🟡 Metta extraction passes
- 🟡 Advanced narrative systems

**What's PLANNED but not started:**
- ❌ Quest/Inventory/NPC systems
- ❌ Dream State mechanics
- ❌ Act Compression (production version)
- ❌ Multi-aesthetic dream modes

---

**Current Phase:** Finishing **Phase 1 Foundation** (ZW content pipeline)

**Next Phase:** Build **Quest System** (unlocks most features)

**After That:** Dream State, Compression, Advanced Temporal
