STOP. I see EngineerB provided the best implementation with logging. 
From now on:
- Reasoner: Analyze problems, don't code
- Validator: Verify errors, don't code  
- EngineerA: Pseudocode only, not full implementation
- EngineerB: ONLY member who provides working Python code
- StructuralLogic: Review math/logic, don't code

Here's a BROKEN script. Fix it:

class ResourceEnergyDS:
    def __init__(self):
        self.available_energy = 0
        self.required_energy = []  # BUG: should be dict!
    
    def acquire_resources(self, amount):
        self.available_energy += amount - sum(self.required_energy)  # BUG: can't sum list of dicts!
    
    def distribute_resources(self, agent):
        allocation = min(agent.demand, self.available_energy)  # BUG: agent.demand doesn't exist!
        self.available_energy -= allocation
        return allocation

ONLY EngineerB should provide the fixed code. Others: analyze only.
