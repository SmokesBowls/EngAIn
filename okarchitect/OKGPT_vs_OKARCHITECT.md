# OKGPT → OKArchitect: Evolution of the Council

## 🎯 The Journey

### OKGPT: The Original Vision (2021-2022)
**Status:** "The Project That Got Away"

**Original Concept:**
- Multi-LLM hub with always-listening background agents
- Voice-activated with wake words ("OK Bob", "OK Rod")
- Hierarchy system preventing interruption
- Each agent responds to previous responses

**Why It Failed:**
- ❌ Models were 60GB+ (GPU farm required)
- ❌ No edge inference (Ollama didn't exist)
- ❌ Massive VRAM requirements
- ❌ API costs would be astronomical
- ❌ No quantization technology

**You were literally 3-4 years ahead of the technology!** 🚀

---

### OKGPT 2.0: The Resurrection (2025)
**Status:** Fully functional multi-agent system

**What Changed:**
- ✅ 7B-13B models that are incredibly capable
- ✅ Ollama runs multiple models on consumer hardware
- ✅ 4-bit quantization = 7B model in ~4GB RAM
- ✅ Local APIs = zero per-token costs
- ✅ Technology finally caught up to your vision

**Current OKGPT Setup:**
```
Bob:    Strategic Thinker (qwen3:8b / GameMaster)
Rod:    Balanced Analyst (dolphin3:8b)
Sarah:  Generalist (llama3:8b)
Quick:  Rapid Response (mistral / phi3)
```

**Purpose:** General-purpose AI consultation and multi-perspective problem solving

**Architecture Features:**
- Sequential consultation (each sees previous responses)
- Individual member consultation ("ok bob [question]")
- Full council mode
- Continuous dialogue
- Timeout handling with backup models
- Memory/history tracking

---

### OKArchitect: Specialized Evolution (2025)
**Status:** New specialized council for technical work

**What's Different:**

| Aspect | OKGPT | OKArchitect |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | General consultation | Game engine development |
| **Members** | Personas (Bob, Rod, Sarah) | Technical specialists |
| **Focus** | Broad problem solving | Systems programming |
| **Best For** | Creative, general questions | Architecture, algorithms, formal patterns |
| **Model Selection** | Balanced generalists | Specialized by domain |

**OKArchitect Council:**
```
Reasoner:        Strategic Architecture    (dolphin-llama3)
Validator:       Fast Validation           (phi3 mini)
EngineerA:       Systems Engineering       (deepseek-coder 6.7b)
EngineerB:       Formal Patterns           (qwen2.5-coder 7b)
StructuralLogic: Mathematical Logic        (structural_llama 3.0)
```

**Optimized For:**
- EngAIn architecture decisions
- ZW protocol design
- AP rules implementation
- ZON transforms
- Cathedral Counter logic

## 📊 When to Use Each

### Use OKGPT When You Need:
- ✅ Brainstorming sessions
- ✅ Creative problem solving
- ✅ Multiple perspectives on decisions
- ✅ General advice and consultation
- ✅ Narrative/lore discussions
- ✅ Non-technical strategy

**Example Questions:**
- "What should my marketing strategy be?"
- "Help me decide between these two story directions"
- "What are the pros and cons of open-sourcing this?"
- "Should I focus on mobile or desktop first?"

---

### Use OKArchitect When You Need:
- ✅ System architecture decisions
- ✅ Code generation and review
- ✅ Algorithm optimization
- ✅ Mathematical/logical analysis
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Formal pattern design
- ✅ ZW/AP/EngAIn specific work

**Example Questions:**
- "Should I use ECS or inheritance for game entities?"
- "How do I optimize this ZW parser?"
- "What's the best way to implement AP rule validation?"
- "Design a 4D memory system for game events"
- "Review this kernel implementation for correctness"

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Comparison

### OKGPT Architecture
```python
class AICouncilMember:
    name: str          # Human-like name (Bob, Sarah)
    model: str         # General-purpose model
    personality: str   # Broad role description

# Sequential consultation with context building
# Focus on natural conversation and perspective
```

### OKArchitect Architecture
```python
class ArchitectMember:
    name: str          # Technical role (Reasoner, EngineerA)
    model: str         # Specialized model for domain
    specialty: str     # Technical domain
    personality: str   # How they approach problems

# Sequential consultation with technical focus
