# MEMORY LAYERS COMPLETE - December 27, 2025

## Achievement:
Built complete "Weaponizing Failure" memory architecture in 15 minutes.

## Systems Built:
1. intent_shadow.py - Shadow memory (what almost happened)
2. history_xeon.py - Causality ledger (WHY things happened)
3. reality_mode.py - Reality context (DRAFT/CANON/DREAM/REPLAY)

## Tests Passing: 24/24 (100%)
- intent_shadow: 6/6
- history_xeon: 6/6
- reality_mode: 6/6
- memory_integration: 6/6

## What This Enables:
- Records rejections alongside successes
- Explains causality (not just mechanics)
- Prevents category errors between modes
- Enables AI learning from failure
- Supports parallel sagas
- Makes "interrogability" structural

## Architecture Status: 7/8 Layers Complete

## Next Steps (Optional):
- Layer 7: Memory pressure/finalization
- Wire to Godot for visual proof
- Build AI agents (Trae, ClutterBot, MrLore)
- Add more subsystems (Spatial3D, Faction3D, etc.)

## Status: MEMORY ARCHITECTURE PROVEN ✅
