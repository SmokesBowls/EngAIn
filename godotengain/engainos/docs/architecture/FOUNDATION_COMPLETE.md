# FOUNDATION COMPLETE - December 27, 2025

## What Was Built Today:

### Systems (7 total):
1. Combat3D Kernel (5/5)
2. Empire Orchestrator (5/5)
3. ZW Core - Semantic Ontology (3/3)
4. AP Core - Rule Enforcement (3/3)
5. Canon - Lifecycle Management (5/5)
6. Replay System (validated)
7. Protocol Envelope (validated)

### Integration:
- Full stack test: 8/8 steps passing
- ZW → AP → Canon → Empire → Combat → Replay
- Complete end-to-end validation

### Architecture:
"AI Logic Built for AI, Not Humans"
- Pure kernels (engine-agnostic)
- Authority tiers (AI-first with human overreach)
- Temporal identity (events have @when/@where)
- Lifecycle management (DRAFT → IMBUED → FINALIZED)
- Deterministic replay (state reconstructible)

### Time Investment: ~6 hours
### Tests Passing: 7/7 (100%)
### Lines of Code: ~1,500

## Next Steps:
- Optional: Build memory layers (intent, causality, reality mode)
- Optional: Wire to Godot for visual proof
- Optional: Build more subsystems (Spatial3D, Faction3D, etc.)

## Status: FOUNDATION PROVEN ✅
