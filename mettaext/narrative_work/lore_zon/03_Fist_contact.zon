@id: senareth had selected three neferati—elyraen for observation skills, vairis for practical thinking, and a fourth named kyreth whose consciousness carried an unusual gentleness—to approach the tree line at first light. the plan was simple: move slowly, maintain non-threatening postures, demonstrate vulnerability through deliberate exposure..unknown

@id: day three: elyraen went alone, moving even more slowly, stopping every few yards to kneel in what they hoped was a submissive gesture. got within twenty yards of the tree line before the same burnt-red giant appeared and drove them back with threatening gestures—massive arms swinging, fists pounding ground..unknown

@id: day four: olythae tried a different approach, bringing art. they arranged colored stones in patterns near the tree line—spirals and waves that mimicked natural formations. left them as offerings, then retreated. the stones were still there at sunset, untouched. but they weren't scattered or destroyed either. that had to mean something..unknown

@id: day six: kyreth returned to the shallows at dawn. torhh emerged from the forest within an hour, as if they'd been waiting. they worked water-patterns together in silence, the communication entirely non-verbal. other giants watched from the tree line—the burnt-red one, several charcoal-grey forms, a few whose coloration mixed green and brown like forest growth..unknown
