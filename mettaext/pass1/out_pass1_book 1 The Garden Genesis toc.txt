{type:narration} Year 0 BH – Year 3500 BH
{type:blank}
{type:narration} Before the First Coming, the heavens were whole.
{type:narration} In the cold expanse beyond the Dragon Nebula, two ancient worlds moved in silent harmony—Mars, veined with rivers and volcanic light, and Tiamat, vast and blue, its oceans alive with creatures born of vrill and starlight.
{type:narration} Upon Tiamat, the Aeon Keepers shaped the flow of creation.
{type:narration} Their luminous kin, the Nehereti, danced between thought and matter, guardians of balance, sculptors of harmony.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} From mountain to sea, their civilization was a fusion of grace and endurance—stonework carved into cliffs, tree-cities grown from living wood.
{type:narration} In the stillness above it all, a lone Nehereti meditated atop a mist-crowned peak, its form half-light, half-dream.
{type:narration} It listened to the rhythm of the planet’s pulse—and heard it falter.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} A tremor rippled through the cosmos.
{type:narration} A red star flared in the distance, expanding into a furious sun.
{type:narration} Marduk, the wandering god-planet, tore across the void, its wake glowing like molten blood.
{type:narration} When it struck, light itself screamed.
{type:narration} Mars burned to ash, and Tiamat shattered into storm and dust.
{type:narration} Fragments of her body scattered through the dark, circling the newborn Earth like mourners in orbit.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} In the silent aftermath, an ethereal library drifted through the debris—its spires veiled in cloud, its runes dimly lit.
{type:narration} The Akashic Records, carrying the memory of a world undone, turned slowly in the vacuum, waiting for a new planet to breathe.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} Three thousand five hundred years passed.
{type:narration} Mars cooled into red desolation.
{type:narration} Earth rose from ruin, green with possibility.
{type:narration} Marduk returned, pulling behind it the fiery planet that had once followed in its shadow, a crimson omen of the next reckoning.

{type:narration} Journal – Keeper Vaelith, Observation 01
{type:blank}
{type:narration} > The wound has closed, but the scar glows still.
{type:narration} I watched the oceans fold themselves anew and the air shimmer as if embarrassed by survival.
{type:narration} Tiamat’s heart beats now within another world, smaller, yet stubbornly alive.
{type:narration} We drift above it, a library without a reader.
{type:narration} I pray that when the next light comes, it finds us worthy of remembering.

{type:narration} Chapter 1 – The Ethereal Vigil
{type:blank}
{type:narration} Prologue — The Cosmic Genesis
{type:blank}
{type:narration} Year 0 BH – Year 3417 BH
{type:blank}
{type:narration} The six Aeon Keepers maintain their watch within the Akashic Records as the shattered world reforms.
{type:narration} Lyaris senses the vrill currents shifting; continents stabilize and oceans clear as new life stirs.
{type:narration} The Pelagor survive the cataclysm, their forms hardening into the first Giants — beings of living stone and breath.
{type:narration} The Keepers, filled with awe and loneliness, decide to shape the Neferati to guide these nascent creatures toward harmony.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} Journal — Keeper Lyaris, Entry #000-Vigil
{type:blank}
{type:narration} > We have lingered in the interval between pulses for three thousand, four hundred and seventeen years.
{type:narration} The planet hums again — its new skin still wet with magma, its veins glowing with unspent vrill.
{type:narration} Tomorrow we will attempt the old miracle — send thought to walk once more.
{type:narration} They will call themselves Neferati, though the name will change as tongues divide.
{type:narration} If this is hubris, let the record show: creation always begins in loneliness.

{type:narration} Year 3417 BH – Year 3420 BH
{type:blank}
{type:narration} A thousand Neferati leap from the Library into forming reality.
{type:narration} Their fall through the Veil is chaos — light grinding into matter, thought compressed into bone and skin.
{type:narration} Senareth, first to coalesce, rises from the sand and sea to find Giants watching with fearful recognition.
{type:narration} The newborn Neferati learn gravity, breath, and limitation, naming patience their first magic.

{type:blank}
{type:narration} > Weight.
{type:narration} That is the first truth of this realm.
{type:narration} Thought no longer moves at the speed of light — it drags bones with it.
{type:narration} The Giants, our elder kin, stand at the tree line and tremble though they could crush us.
{type:narration} Their eyes carry a memory I do not own; I think it is of fire.
{type:narration} We will learn their fear before we teach them peace, and call this waiting the first magic of flesh.

{type:narration} > We awaken upon the skin of a new world, spun from Tiamat’s marrow.
{type:narration} The seas are still warm with memory.
{type:narration} Mountains breathe like sleeping titans,
{type:narration} and the air itself trembles with vrill-song.
{type:narration} We, the Aeon Keepers,
{type:narration} drift between form and light, testing the edges of this gravity-bound dream.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} No shadow of Marduk’s flame lingers here — only the echo of its judgment.
{type:narration} From that ruin, we cultivate order: seed-codes of life, slow rivers of memory.
{type:narration} Giants stir beneath basalt wombs, shaped by patience rather than command.
{type:narration} The Neferati dance along the horizon, bright as thought before language.

{type:narration} Record 9 — When Stone Remembered Water
{type:narration} Time: Day 9 of Tiamatra, Year 9 BH
{type:blank}
{type:narration} > The island trembled as the Giants gathered — not in war, but in awakening.
{type:narration} I felt the pulse of their hearts through the bedrock, a thousand rhythms seeking one harmony.
{type:narration} We, the unseen Keepers, dared not interfere.
{type:narration} The Prime whispered only: “Observe.”
{type:blank}
{type:narration} From the sea came the jade-greens, heavy with memory; from the mountain, the frost-veined elders; from sand and root, the copper and the moss-born.
{type:narration} They spoke in harmonics older than wind.
{type:narration} And at their center stood Senareth — small, bright, unyielding — offering apology for wounds carved into time itself.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} When Torhh knelt, the cosmos exhaled.
{type:narration} The trauma of Tiamat found its first salve.
{type:narration} Stone touched light, fear touched empathy, and for a heartbeat the Garden remembered what it meant to breathe together.
{type:blank}
{type:narration} We marked this day as the first true Convergence.
{type:narration} The earth did not change — awareness did.
{type:narration} From such tremors, civilizations are born.
