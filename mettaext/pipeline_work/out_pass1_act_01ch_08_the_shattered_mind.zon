    type: narration
    text: "The sensation was nothing like the smooth translation that the Network had been designed to provide under normal circumstances—this was catastrophic ejection, the equivalent of being torn from one reality and hurled bodily into another without the careful preparation and guidance that made such journeys survivable."

  - line: 11
    type: narration
    text: "But even his enhanced resilience and awakened abilities couldn't prevent the violent translation from dimensional travel to physical reality from driving the breath from their lungs and leaving them sprawled in what appeared to be a crater of their own making."
