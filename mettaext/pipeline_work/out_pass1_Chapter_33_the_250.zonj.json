It draws power from the lingering instability.\" Geralt frowned. \"An echo? Like the unmade?\" Kaelen shook her head sharply. \"No. This is a psychic imprint, a stain left by its presence. But even stains can fester. Left unchecked, it could seed new paradoxes or attract worse scavengers.\" She turned to him. \"You must purge it. Not with force, but with resonance. Your tripartite harmony – applicator, armor, will – must resonate against its frequency. Cancel it out.\""

The dragon armor hummed faintly, a low thrum of defiance against the despair. Zaron wasn't done. Neither was he. He pushed himself upright, ignoring the agony in his side. \"Then I master it.\" His voice was raw, but steady. \"Where do I start?\" Kaelen pointed towards a newly formed fracture pulsing sickly violet near the petrified forest shard. \"There. A chroniton cascade. Stabilize it before it collapses further. Anchor yourself first. Your signature is frayed.\" Geralt nodded, the applicator spitting static as he locked onto the violet pulse.
