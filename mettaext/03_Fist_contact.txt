# Part 3: First Contact

The first night was the longest Senareth had ever experienced.

Not because of duration—they had no reference point for how physical time felt compared to ethereal existence—but because of the weight of it. Each moment seemed to compress under its own gravity, minutes stretching into subjective hours as their newly-formed body tried to process the overwhelming cascade of sensation that darkness brought.

The sun had set with a finality that felt almost threatening. In the Ethereal Realm, light and dark were choices—dimensional frequencies that consciousness could tune to or ignore. But here, darkness was a *thing*. An absence that pressed against their new eyes, that made the ocean sounds seem louder, that transformed the distant tree line into an impenetrable wall of uncertainty.

The Giants had withdrawn entirely once night fell. Even Torhh—the jade-green one whose curiosity had kept it lingering longer than the others—had finally retreated into the forest. Senareth had watched its massive form disappear between trees that barely came to its shoulders, leaving only the faintest vibration in the earth to mark its passage.

Now two hundred Neferati huddled on the beach, their bioluminescent skin providing the only light beyond starshine. They glowed with soft blues and greens and purples—the residual vrill-energy of their manifestation expressing itself as visible radiance. It was beautiful, in a way. Like living auroras scattered across sand.

But it also made them vulnerable. Visible. Targets, if the Giants chose to see them that way.

"We should establish shelter," Vairis said, their practical nature asserting itself even through exhaustion. They had spent the afternoon experimenting with their new body's capabilities, and now sat with arms wrapped around knees, conserving warmth. "Before tomorrow. These forms need protection from elements."

"Shelter might seem threatening," Elyraen countered, their analytical mind still focused on the Giants' reactions. "We don't understand their territorial markers yet. Building structures might be interpreted as claiming land."

"We're already claiming land," Olythae observed quietly. They had been drawing patterns in the sand—unconscious artistic expression flowing through fingers still learning fine motor control. "Our presence is a claim, whether we build or not."

Senareth listened to the discussion ripple through the assembled Neferati. Different perspectives, different priorities, all valid. But beneath the surface dialogue ran a deeper current of uncertainty. None of them had expected fear. The briefing—that compressed understanding of purpose they'd received during descent—had prepared them for curiosity, maybe caution. Not terror.

*Why are they afraid of us?* The question had repeated through Senareth's consciousness all day, finding no answer. The Aeon Keepers hadn't sent clarification. Either they didn't know, or they were waiting for the Neferati to discover the truth themselves.

"Tomorrow we try again," Senareth said, their voice carrying quiet authority across the assembled group. "But differently. Today we approached as a collective—two hundred beings moving toward them. That's overwhelming. Tomorrow we send individuals. Small groups. Give them opportunities to engage without feeling surrounded."

"And if they flee again?" someone asked from the darkness beyond the bioluminescent glow.

"Then we learn from how they flee," Elyraen answered before Senareth could. "Direction, speed, which ones hesitate longest. Every reaction is information."

Senareth felt gratitude ripple through their Prime connection—not from the Aeon Keepers, but from their own consciousness recognizing kindred spirit. Elyraen understood observation, patient data collection. They would be valuable in the work ahead.

"Rest now," Senareth instructed. "These bodies require... what was the term?" They searched the biological knowledge woven into their consciousness-pattern. "Sleep. Periodic shutdown for repair and integration. We'll need full functionality tomorrow."

The Neferati began settling into the sand, arranging themselves in loose clusters for warmth and security. Their bioluminescence dimmed as consciousness retreated inward, though never extinguishing entirely. Some part of them remained perpetually aware—a vestige of ethereal existence that physical form couldn't entirely override.

Senareth remained awake longer, staring toward the tree line where the Giants had disappeared. Somewhere in that darkness, forty-foot-tall beings made of living stone were probably watching. Probably discussing in whatever way they communicated. Probably trying to understand these small glowing creatures as much as the creatures were trying to understand them.

*Tomorrow,* Senareth thought, feeling the Prime connection pulse with faint encouragement from dimensions away. *Tomorrow we bridge this gap.*

Day two began with failure.

Senareth had selected three Neferati—Elyraen for observation skills, Vairis for practical thinking, and a fourth named Kyreth whose consciousness carried an unusual gentleness—to approach the tree line at first light. The plan was simple: move slowly, maintain non-threatening postures, demonstrate vulnerability through deliberate exposure.

They made it perhaps thirty yards before the first Giant emerged from the forest—not Torhh, but a larger one whose stone-flesh carried the burnt-red coloration of desert minerals. It saw them, released a warning rumble that made the ground shake, and the entire forest seemed to pull backward. Trees swayed as multiple Giants retreated simultaneously, their massive forms creating a cascade of motion that sent birds scattering into the dawn sky.

The three Neferati froze, then slowly backed away. No point pursuing when the reaction was so clear.

"Smaller group next time," Vairis muttered as they returned to the beach. "Maybe just one of us."

Day three: Elyraen went alone, moving even more slowly, stopping every few yards to kneel in what they hoped was a submissive gesture. Got within twenty yards of the tree line before the same burnt-red Giant appeared and drove them back with threatening gestures—massive arms swinging, fists pounding ground.

Day four: Olythae tried a different approach, bringing art. They arranged colored stones in patterns near the tree line—spirals and waves that mimicked natural formations. Left them as offerings, then retreated. The stones were still there at sunset, untouched. But they weren't scattered or destroyed either. That had to mean something.

Day five brought the first breakthrough, though it came by accident rather than design.

Kyreth had been practicing vrill-manipulation in the shallows, learning to sense the currents beneath ocean's surface. The water responded to consciousness-touch more readily than stone or air—maybe because it was already in motion, already flowing. Kyreth had managed to create small whirlpools, spirals that spun in response to focused intention.

They hadn't noticed Torhh emerge from the forest. Hadn't realized the jade-green Giant had approached to within forty feet—closer than any Giant had ventured since the landing. Torhh stood at the boundary where sand met vegetation, massive body perfectly still, watching.

Watching the water spiral.

When Kyreth finally sensed the presence and turned, terror flooded through their newly-formed nervous system. They stumbled backward, lost concentration, and the whirlpool collapsed into chaotic waves.

But Torhh didn't advance. Didn't threaten. Just... stood there. Those deep ocean-colored eyes fixed not on Kyreth, but on the water where the spiral had been.

Slowly, with movements that seemed impossible for something so massive, Torhh knelt. Placed one enormous hand into the shallows. And waited.

Kyreth stood frozen, heart—*they had a heart now, a physical organ that pounded with chemical fear*—hammering in their chest. What was the Giant doing? Was this attack? Submission? Request?

*Show them,* came the faint impression through Senareth's Prime connection. Not instruction, just... suggestion. Encouragement.

Kyreth swallowed—another new sensation, the physical manifestation of decision-making—and slowly approached the water's edge. Not close enough to touch the Giant's hand. But close enough that their vrill-manipulation might reach the same water.

They focused. Extended consciousness-touch into the shallows. Found the currents, the flows, the quantum potential within liquid form. And gently, carefully, created another spiral.

The water responded, spinning in a slow vortex between Kyreth's position and Torhh's hand. The Giant's eyes widened—an expression that transcended species, pure recognition. The massive fingers spread, and the water's motion changed. Not spiraling now, but rippling outward in concentric circles that intersected with Kyreth's vortex, creating interference patterns that caught sunlight and scattered it into rainbow fragments.

They worked the water together for perhaps ten minutes—Kyreth creating patterns, Torhh responding with different ones, each learning how the other manipulated flow. No words. No shared language. Just consciousness meeting consciousness through the medium of shaped reality.

When Torhh finally stood and retreated into the forest, Kyreth remained kneeling in the shallows, trembling with emotions they couldn't name yet. Wonder. Triumph. Relief. Hope.

By sunset, Senareth had heard the full account from five different Neferati who had witnessed the interaction from various distances. The story rippled through the assembled community, transforming from report into revelation.

"They can manipulate vrill," Elyraen said, their analytical voice carrying undertones of excitement. "Crudely, instinctively, but the capability is there. Which means—"

"They have the potential we were sent to develop," Senareth finished. "They're not primitive beings who need to be taught from nothing. They're... unrefined practitioners. Students who already know the basics but lack technique."

"That changes everything," Vairis observed. "We're not civilizing them. We're refining what already exists."

The distinction mattered. Partnership rather than tutelage. Collaboration between equals with different skill sets rather than teachers instructing pupils. It shifted the entire foundation of how they would approach the Giants going forward.

Day six: Kyreth returned to the shallows at dawn. Torhh emerged from the forest within an hour, as if they'd been waiting. They worked water-patterns together in silence, the communication entirely non-verbal. Other Giants watched from the tree line—the burnt-red one, several charcoal-grey forms, a few whose coloration mixed green and brown like forest growth.

By afternoon, a second Giant had joined them. This one smaller than Torhh—perhaps only twenty-five feet tall—with copper-toned stone-flesh that seemed to shimmer in sunlight. It knelt further up the beach, where wet sand met dry, and began shaping the boundary. Not with hands, but with consciousness-touch. The sand responded, flowing like water, creating patterns that Senareth recognized as similar to the spirals Olythae had arranged days earlier.

Olythae, watching from the Neferati assembly, made a small sound of recognition. "They saw the offering. They understood it was communication."

By day seven, five Giants were participating in what had become a kind of wordless dialogue. They maintained distance—never approaching within twenty feet of the Neferati—but the barrier of terror had cracked. Curiosity was winning.

Senareth stood at the edge of the Neferati cluster, watching Kyreth and Torhh work increasingly complex water-patterns while Olythae engaged the copper-toned Giant in sand-shaping exercises. Elyraen was nearby, observing a charcoal-grey Giant who seemed fascinated by the way Neferati bioluminescence intensified in response to emotional states.

Seven days. One breakthrough. The beginning of something that might eventually become understanding.

But Senareth felt the weight of time pressing against their consciousness. Five hundred years. That's how long the Garden would need to reach its peak. Five hundred years of slowly building trust, teaching refined technique, bridging the gap between instinct and art.

And they had barely managed seven days.

*Patience,* came the faint impression through the Prime connection. The Aeon Keepers, offering the only guidance that mattered: *Patience, and persistence. Rome wasn't built in a day.*

Senareth didn't know what Rome was—the reference existed in knowledge-space they couldn't quite access—but the meaning was clear. Great works took time. Gardens didn't bloom overnight. Trust was earned in increments too small to measure until enough accumulated to transform uncertainty into alliance.

"Tomorrow," Senareth said to the assembled Neferati as sunset painted the sky in shades that their new eyes found achingly beautiful, "we try language. Sound-patterns they can interpret. The first words of what will become the First Tongue."

Around them, bioluminescence flickered with anticipation and trepidation in equal measure. They had crossed the first threshold. Now came the real work.
